# Restoring_Divider
design and implementation of a 10 bit by 5 bit binary restoring divider with Verilog
Different modules like adder, register, shift register, up counter, multiplexer and comparator were used in this project. Each of these modules is defined in the Modules.v file. Both the controller and the datapath are seperately defined in the Controller.v and Datapath.v files. The top level module of the final divider is inititated in Divider.v. Also a test bench was implemented to check the function of the divider, which is shown in the Divider_TB.v file.
